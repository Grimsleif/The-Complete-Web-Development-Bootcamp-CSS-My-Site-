      <h2>Hello.</h2>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I have been studying Web Development with Dr. Angela Yu and her fantastic course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp</a>. I've also been using a variety
          of other online courses. I find combining my creative, artistic, and technical skills together to be a rewarding experience, and I look forward to working in a new field.</p>

        <h3>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h3>
        <p>I have a great love and respect for the martial arts. Nothing has built up my confidence and physique quite like Jiu Jitsu. I had been training at my local gym <a href="https://www.allliancejiujitsumaryland.com/">The Foundry</a> for a few years, but had to stop because of the pandemic. I am eager
          to return to my training as soon as I can.</p>

        <h3>Song Writing</h3>
        <p>I have been playing music for over half my life. Currently I am the main songwriter in a DC area punk band called <a href="https://failsonsdc.bandcamp.com/">Fail Sons</a>. We've put one demo, one EP, and one split, and we're working on a
          full length for 2021. If you like agressive, catchy, angry pop punk you'll like us. We released our most recent tape on <a href="https://bloatedkatrecords.bandcamp.com/">Bloated Kat Records</a>. We're also featured on a compilation called
          <a href="https://bloatedkatrecords.bandcamp.com/album/kat-music-for-kat-people-volume-vi-god-emperor-of-tune">Kat Music For Kat People Volume VI: God Emperor Of Tune</a>.

        <h3>Mead Brewing</h3>
        <p>Over the past year I have begun brewing my own mead. It connects me with an ancient and distant part of my ancestry, plus my basement is now filled with jugs of sweet, floral, honey wine! If guests ever row their longboats to my home I'll
          be well prepared.</p>
